## What is SmartRoot?

SmartRoot is a semi-automated image analysis software which streamlines the quantification of root growth and architecture for complex root systems.

The software combines a vectorial representation of root objects with a powerful tracing algorithm which accommodates to a wide range of image source and quality.

The software supports a sampling-based analysis of root system images, in which detailed information is collected on a limited number of roots selected by the user according to specific research requirements.

SmartRoot is an operating system independent freeware based on ImageJ and uses cross-platform standards (XML, SQL, Java) for communication with data analysis softwares.
